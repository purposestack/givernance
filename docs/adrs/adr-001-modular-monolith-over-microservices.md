## ADR-001: Modular Monolith over Microservices

- **Status**: Accepted
- **Date**: 2025-12
- **Deciders**: Magino (founder/architect)

### Context

Givernance targets NPOs with 2–200 staff. The system must support multi-tenancy, GDPR compliance, and a growing feature set (contacts, donations, grants, cases, volunteers, reporting). The team is a solo developer in Phase 0 with plans to grow to 3–5 engineers by Phase 2.

### Decision

Use a **modular monolith** architecture with well-defined bounded contexts, deployed as a single process, with the option to extract modules into services later.

### Rationale

- A single deployment unit minimizes operational complexity for a small team
- Bounded contexts enforce separation at the code level (module boundaries, dependency rules) without the overhead of network calls
- Shared database with schema-per-module enables transactional consistency where needed
- Migration to microservices is possible later by extracting modules along existing boundaries
- Operational cost of Kubernetes + service mesh + distributed tracing for microservices is disproportionate for the current team size and user base

### Rejected Alternatives

| Option | Pros | Cons | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| Microservices from day one | Independent scaling, team autonomy | Massive ops overhead for solo dev, distributed transactions, complex debugging | Rejected |
| Traditional monolith (no module boundaries) | Simple to start | Becomes tangled quickly, hard to extract later | Rejected |
| **Modular monolith** | Clean boundaries, single deployment, extractable | Requires discipline to maintain module boundaries | **Selected** |

### Consequences

- Module boundaries must be enforced via linting rules and code review
- Inter-module communication uses in-process function calls (not HTTP/gRPC)
- Database migrations are scoped per module but run in a single migration pipeline
- Phase 4+ may extract high-traffic modules (e.g., reporting, AI) into separate services
